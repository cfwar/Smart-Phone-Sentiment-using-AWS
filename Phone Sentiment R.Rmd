## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Required
library(doParallel)

# Find how many cores are on your machine
detectCores() # Result = Typically 4 to 6

# Create Cluster with desired number of cores. Don't use them all! Your computer is running other processes. 
cl <- makeCluster(2)

# Register Cluster
registerDoParallel(cl)

# Confirm how many cores are now "assigned" to R and RStudio
getDoParWorkers() # Result 2 

# Stop Cluster. After performing your tasks, stop your cluster. 
stopCluster(cl)

#view data
library(readr)
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
iphonedata <- read_csv("~/Documents/Course 4 Task 3/C4T3/iphone_smallmatrix_labeled_8d.csv")
View(iphonedata)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
